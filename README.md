# Library
 
Hello buddies!!

I have created a console based Library management program. Here you can create new account or log in to an existing account.
You will be able to add new book, make changes to the book. Furthermore just like a real library you can lend and return book for certain amount of period.
Lastly, you can request any book and that data will be stored in a text based file.
Out program is also capable of providing link for the book on online.

The whole program is console based and also, all of the data is stored in the excel file which is in format(.xlsx).
I have added required modules which I have used in the project is mentioned in the requirements.txt. Furthermore, if you wat the rough idea of the whole project, then you can get it from outline.txt

Whole code is divided in different functions and classes and it is free to use....

Enjoy.......

If there is any problem in the code or you want to give your suggestion for the code then you can contact me by email maharshichokshi2003@gmail.com
